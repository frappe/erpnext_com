# Distribution

### Introduction

Today the manufacturers and suppliers are building direct relationships with large wholesale customers. The information age is promoting price transparency at a lightening speed. As a result your clout and ability to earn on the markup price is diminishing. The manufacturers and customers are driving competition amongst distributors, reducing your markup prices and in turn your margins.

To survive in this era you can:

1. Differentiate yourself by offering reliable and timely service.
1. Run the business with optimal efficiency by carrying out effective stock management
1. Follow systematic accounting practices to manage accruals, collections and payments.
