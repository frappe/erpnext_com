# Rohit Industries Group, India

When Aditya Duggal decided to blog for the first time, he wrote a blog on
ERPNext Implementation story. He began by saying that “I have been compelled
by my conscience to write about this product which has put all my plans in
place for my organisation”.

#### Company and Products

Rohit Industries Group Pvt Ltd, is a manufacturing company that develops cutting tools. They have developed more than 80,000 different sizes &
shapes of HSS & Solid Carbide Cutting Tools. 

#### The Challenge

When Aditya joined his company, he saw that all the work was being done on paper. The whole business was handheld by his father. If somebody ordered something, it was written on a piece of paper and that paper would be passed from one hand to the other, till the product was delivered. It would take at least 2-3 days to find out a list of all pending orders.

#### The Solution

Being an organised person, he decided to put the business in order by getting
a very good ERP. He shortlisted SAP for his business. However, he realised
that it was exorbitant. He was not willing to risk his business operations by
buying such a costly product. So he kept his search on. While he was searching
for a perfect ERP which could be customised to his business, he made other
changes. The first thing he started was to establish a culture of
systematising order data. He also enumerated the importance of making stock
entry. It was a change for him and for the people who worked with him. There
were lot of fights. It was a culture shock for people to work in an organised
manner.

#### Discovering ERPNext

While making changes in his organisation, he was also looking for applications
to run his business. He gathered that there was no standard application that
was good in everything. Some apps were good for inventory management but not
good for accounting , some were not equipped to share over the internet . So
he managed his invoices in Quickbooks and did accounting in Tally. He did not
like Tally, because it was difficult to import in Tally. He also tried his
luck with open-source projects like Openbravo, but their implementation was
too complex and implementation cost was high. He even tried his own tailor-made software for his business, which did not work. Just when he was about to
give-up, he came across ERPNext. He liked ERPNext and the entry-level pricing
that allowed him to try it. Once he saw the benefits of ERPNext and its
ability to customise, he replaced Tally and Quickbooks with ERPNext.

#### Best Features of ERPNext as per Aditya

  * ERPNext has low entry cost.
  * Is web-based, so no need of installing computer software at client location.
  * Is Online, thus there is real-time sharing of data across the world
  * Imports data easily from excel. The import formats are all saved in the system.
  * Is a robust system which can handle many users at any given time.
  * Needs no installation on any computer, just internet and a browser is sufficient.

Aditya confirms that the best part about the software is that, it is easily
customisable. He has done a lot of customisation for his organisation. He is
very satisfied with the speed and accuracy of the service and the support he
gets . Having said that, it also needs to be mentioned that every-time ERPNext
provides updates and new features, he has to run hither-thither to get
everybody on the same page. Being the ERP Champion, he has to be ready to
douse any fire that arises on account of new feature addition. He has seen
many software vendors who are good at coding but not so good at understanding
the needs of the customers with regards to manufacturing. With ERPNext, he has
found a fusion of both.

Aditya played a major role in transforming Rohit Industries, from a 400000
dollars company to 3 million dollars professionally managed organisation. His
journey is continuous and he is constantly striving to channel his company
towards unprecedented success.
