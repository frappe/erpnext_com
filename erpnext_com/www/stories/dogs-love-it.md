This initiative has helped a lot of dogs with special condition diets, to live a healthy and hearty life.

At a very early stage of the startup, Dr. Robert realised that they need to record inventory, sales and purchases. They knew that maintaining records served as a good practice and was essential for tax and VAT purposes. Thus, they started scouting for a good ERP.

#### Discovering ERPNext

The key feature they were looking for in their ERP was that the system should not be location specific. They needed  a system that would work on internet and avoid all the issues that come with a location specific ERP. They found many solutions in the Dutch market. However, a quick calculation revealed that the cost of ERPs available in their market was not justifiable in comparison to the revenue and profits of Dogs Love It. Thus, began their google journey to identify a cost-effective ERP. They evaluated a couple of ERPs and finally took a decision to buy ERPNext. Dr. Becht, says that he has never regretted this decision. He says “ERPNext is very user and service oriented”.
