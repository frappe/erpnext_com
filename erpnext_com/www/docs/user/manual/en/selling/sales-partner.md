# Sales Partner

**Sales Partners are people or companies that assist you in getting business.**

Sales Partners can be represented by different names in ERPNext. You can call them Channel Partner, Distributor, Dealer, Agent, Retailer, Implementation Partner, Reseller, etc.

For each Sales Partner, you can define a commission rate. When a Sales Partner is selected in transactions, their commission is calculated over Net Total of Sales Order/Invoice or Delivery Note.

You can track Sales Partner-wise commission in the 'Sales Partners Commission' report under Selling module.

2. Enter the Sales Partner name and the Commission Rate.
3. You can also select the type of sales partner you're creating to identify if they're a Reseller or Retailer, and so on.
4. Save.
