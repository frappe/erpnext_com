# Quotation

**A quotation is an estimated cost of the products/services you're selling to your future/present customer.** 

During a sale, a customer may request for a note about the products
or services you are planning to offer along with the prices and other terms
of engagement. This has many names like "Proposal", Estimate", "Pro Forma
Invoice" or a **Quotation**.

A typical sales flow looks like:

* **Shipping Address:** Address where the items will be shipped to.
* **Contact Person:** If your customer is an organization, then you can add the person to contact in this field.
* **Territory:** Region where the customer belongs to. Default is All Territories. 

### 2.2 Currency and Price List
You can set the currency in which the quotation is to be sent. If you set a Pricing List, then the item prices will be fetched from that list. Ticking on Ignore Pricing Rule will ignore the Pricing Rules set in Accounts > Pricing Rule.

The rates you quote may depend on two things.

  * **The Price List**: If you have multiple Price Lists, you can select a Price List or tag it to the Customer (so that it is auto-selected). Your Item prices will automatically be updated from the Price List. For details refer [Price List](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/price-lists)

  * **The Currency**: If you are quoting to a Customer in a different currency, you will have to update the conversion rates to enable ERPNext to save the information in your standard Currency. This will help you to analyze the value of your Quotations in standard Currency.

### 2.3 The Items Table
This table can be expanded by clicking on the inverted triangle present rightmost of the table.

* On selecting Item Code, the following will be fetched automatically: item name, description, any image if set, quantity default as 1, the rates. You can add discounts in the Discounts and Margin section.

* **Item weights** will be fetched if set in the Item master.
* In **Warehouse and Reference**, the warehouse will be fetched from the Item master, this is the warehouse where your stock is present.

### 2.4 Taxes and Charges
Tax category is linked to [Tax Rule](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/tax-rule). This Tax Category can be assigned to a Customer, so when that customer is selected, the Tax Category will be fetched. This will fetch the Sales Tax Template linked to the Tax Rule. Hence, the rows in the Tax table will be automatically filled. Tax Category can be used to group customers to whom same tax will be applied. For example: Government, NGO, commercial, etc,.
