# Introduction

Distributors have a large part of their financial resources invested in the stock items they trade. With ERPNext, you can always keep a birds eye view on your stock availability, replenishment, procurement, and sales.

## 1. Material Flow
There are three main types of entries:

* **Purchase Receipt**: Items received from Suppliers against Purchase Orders.
* **Stock Entry**: Items transferred from one Warehouse to another.
* **Delivery Note**: Items shipped to Customers.

Here's a view of stock in ERPNext.

## 2. More than Sales and Purchase

Distributors need a lot more than just a [sales](/docs/user/manual/en/selling) and a [purchase](/docs/user/manual/en/buying) module for running their businesses. With ERPNext you can:

- Track your books of accounts using the [Accounts module](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts).
- Manage payroll, leaves, and claims of your support staff in the [HR module](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources).
- Attend customer's support queries better with the [Support](/docs/user/manual/en/support) module.

## 3. A Distributor talks about ERPNext Implementation

When Tarun Gupta's security services startup Neural Integrated Services started growing, his ERP could not keep up and was full of bugs in spite of spending a lot of money. Thats when Tarun decided to move to something better and discovered ERPNext.
