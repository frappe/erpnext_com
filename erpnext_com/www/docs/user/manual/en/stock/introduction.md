Distributors have a large part of their financial resources invested in the stock items they trade. With ERPNext, you can always keep a birds eye view on your stock availability, replenishment, procurement, and sales.

There are three main types of entries:

* **Purchase Receipt**: Items received from Suppliers against Purchase Orders.
* **Stock Entry**: Items transferred from one Warehouse to another.
* **Delivery Note**: Items shipped to Customers.
