# Retaining Sample Stock

A sample of a batch of starting material, packaging material or finished product is stored for the purpose of being analyzed should the need arise later.

### 1. How to Set Sample Retention Warehouse in Stock Settings

It is advised to create a new warehouse just for retaining samples and not use it in production.

Check Retain Sample and Maximum allowed samples in Item Master for a batch. Please note that Retain Sample is based
on Batch hence Has Batch No should be enabled as well.
