#### 2.1 Additional Costs

If the stock entry is an incoming entry i.e any item is receiving at a target warehouse, you can add related additional costs (like Shipping Charges, Customs Duty, Operating Costs etc) associated with the process. The additional costs will be considered to calculate valuation rate of the items.

To add additional costs, enter the description and amount of the cost in the Additional Costs table.

The added additional costs will be distributed among the receiving items (where the target warehouse mentioned) proportionately based on Basic Amount of the items. And the distributed additional cost will be added to the basic rate of the item, to calculate valuation rate.

Quantity and Rate is shown as follows when you expand the Items table.
