## Pick List

A pick list is a document that indicates which items should be taken from your inventory to fulfill orders. This is particularly useful for shippers with a large amount of inventory, volume of orders, or customers ordering many SKUs.

> Home > Stock > Pick List

## How to create Pick List

1. Go To Pick List, click on New.
1. Set Company.
1. Select the Purpose of Pick List. There are following options under Purpose.

  - **Delivery against Sales Order:** This option will let you add items from Sales Order. After stock picking new delivery note can be created based on the warehouse from which items were picked.

  - **Material Transfer for Manufacture:** This will let you select Work Order from which raw materials will be pulled for picking. You will be presented with an option to select the number of finished goods item for which you want to pick raw materials for. Once the stock picking is done you can create Stock Entry for the picked items i.e., raw materials.
