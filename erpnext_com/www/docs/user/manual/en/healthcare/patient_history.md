# Patient Medical History

Maintenance of accurate and complete medical records of patients is one of the rudiments for healthcare practitioners and providers. Over and above, the ease at which the information is accessible by a practitioner is critical in rendering effective, high quality care.

ERPNext Healthcare helps you to draw up the medical history of a Patient anytime by quickly searching and selecting the Patient.

To view the Patient History, you can go to:

> Home > Healthcare > Records and History > Patient History

_View > Patient History_ button is available in all forms which Healthcare Practitioners use, so that they can easily switch to the "Patient  History" page to view the patient history.

## Adding Medical Records Manually

Medical Record automatically keeps track of all Complaints, Diagnosis and other information captured as part of a Patient Encounter, Vital Signs, Lab Investigations, ordered Clinical Procedures, Admissions etc.

In the Patient document, _Create > Medical Record_ will allow you to record notes manually. You can also attach files when doing this, and the Medical Record will display links to the attached file alongside the notes. It's also possible to add Medical Records from the Patient Encounter.
