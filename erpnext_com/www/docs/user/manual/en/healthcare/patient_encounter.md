# Patient Encounter
ERPNext Healthcare allows you to record every encounter with patients through the Patient Encounter document. You can create a Patient Encounter based on a previously booked Appointment or directly by creating a new Patient Encounter

`Healthcare > Patient Care > Patient Encounter`

You can also create and record encounter details for a patient from Patient Appointment, the Patient Encounter or the Patient master documents by using the `Create > Patient Encounter` button. If creating a Patient Encounter manually, you can search for a Patient by name, email phone number etc. In the Patient Encounter document, all Patient related details will automatically be populated enabling easy access to relevant data. The Patient Details section will list the latest Vital Signs record of the patient and other information captured in the Patient screen. You can also look up the Patient Health History by using the `View > Medical Record` button.
