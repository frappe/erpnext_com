Customize Form is the tool which allows user to customize property of the standard fields, and insert [custom fields](/docs/user/manual/en/customize-erpnext/custom-field) as per the requirement. Let's assume we need to set Project Name field as a mandatory field in the Sales Order form. Following are the steps which shall be followed to achieve this.

>Note: Though we want you to do everything you can to customize your ERP based on your business needs, we recommend that you do not make “wild” changes to the forms. This is because, these changes may affect certain operations and may mess up your forms. Make small changes and see its effect before doing some more.
