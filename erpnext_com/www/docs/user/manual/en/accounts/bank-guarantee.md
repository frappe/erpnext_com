# Bank Guarantee

A Bank Guarantee is a guarantee from a lending institution such as a bank ensuring the liabilities of a debtor will be met. In other words, if the debtor fails to settle a debt, the bank covers it. A Bank Guarantee enables the customer, or debtor, to acquire goods, buy equipment or draw down loans, and thereby expand business activity.

A client may ask you to provide a Bank Guarantee from a third party such as a bank. This guarantee is for a specified amount, which is usually a percentage of the total value of the contract. The Bank Guarantee is valid for a specified duration after which it expires and must be returned to you by the client.
