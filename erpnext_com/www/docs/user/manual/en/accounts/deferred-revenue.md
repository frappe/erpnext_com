# Deferred Revenue

**Deferred revenue refers to advance payments a Company receives for products or services that are to be delivered or performed in the future.** 

It is also known as unearned revenue.

The company that receives the prepayment records the amount as Deferred Revenue on their balance sheet as a liability. Deferred revenue is a liability because it refers to revenue that has not been earned and represents products or services that are owed to a Customer. As the product or service is delivered over time, it is recognized as revenue on the income statement.

## 1. How to use Deferred Revenue

Internet and broadcasting service providers offer subscription plans on quarterly or yearly basis. They take complete payment in advance from the Customer for couple of months, but book income on monthly basis in their book of accounts. This is Deferred Revenue for the Supplier and [Deferred Expense](/docs/user/manual/en/accounts/deferred-expense) for the Customer. Following is how they should configure Deferred Revenue accounting in ERPNext to automate the process.

### 1.1 Item
