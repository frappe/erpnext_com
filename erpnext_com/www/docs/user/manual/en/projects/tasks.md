# Tasks

Project is divided into Tasks. 
In ERPNext, you can also create a Task independently.

### Status of the Task

A Task can have one of the following statuses - Open, Working, Pending Review, Closed, or Cancelled.

* By default each new Task created has the status set to 'Open'.

* If a Time Log is made against a task, its status will be set to 'Working'.

### Dependent Task

You can specify a list of dependent tasks under the 'Depends On' section.

* You cannot close the parent task until all dependent tasks are closed.

* If the dependent tasks are delayed and overlap with the expected Start Date of the Parent task, the system will reschedule the parent task.

### Managing Time

ERPNext uses [Time Log](/docs/user/manual/en/projects/time-log.html) to track the progress of a Task.
You can create multiple Time Logs against each task.
The Actual Start and End Time along with the costing is updated based on the Time Log.

* To view Time Log made against a Task click on 'Time Logs'

<img class="screenshot" alt="Task - Time Log List" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/task_time_log_list.png">

* You can also create a Time Log directly and link it to the Task.

### Managing Expenses

You can book [Expense Claim](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/expense-claim.html) against a task.
The system shall update the total amount from expense claims in the costing section.

* To view Expense Claims made against a Task click on 'Expense Claims'

<img class="screenshot" alt="Task - View Expense Claim" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/task_view_expense_claim.png">

* You can also create a Expense Claims directly and link it to the Task.

<img class="screenshot" alt="Task - Link Expense Claim" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/project/task_expense_claim_link.png">
