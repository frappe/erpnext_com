# Project Management

The project is an individual or collaborative enterprise, possibly involving research or design, that is carefully planned, usually by a project team, to achieve a particular aim

In ERPNext, Project management in is Task driven. You can a create Project and divide into multiple and assignable Tasks.

### Managing Tasks

The project is generally has a broader scope, and hence not assignable to an individual. Hence, you can divide the Project into multiple Tasks. These can be assigned to an individual and tracked better. 

These Tasks can be created from a Project itself or a [Task](/docs/user/manual/en/projects/tasks.html) can be created separately as well.

  1. Task Completion
  2. Task Progress
  3. Task Weight

### Project Costing

The Project Costing section helps you track the time, expenses and purchases incurred against the project.

* The Total Cost is composed of the costing amount from timesheets, the total cost of expense claims and the total cost of purchase invoices created against this project.

* The Gross Margin is the difference between Total Billed Amount and the Total Cost Amount for this project.

### Gantt Chart

ERPNext gives you an illustrated view of tasks scheduled for that project in Gantt Chart View.

* To view Gantt chart against a project, go to the Task list and Apply filter on the Project.
