# Timesheet based on Work Order

**Creating Timesheet for Work Order helps for capacity planning at the Workstations. It also helps in tracking actual time consumed by the Workstation for completing specific operation.**

When a Work Order is submitted, based on the Planned Start Date and the availability of the Workstations, system schedules all the operations by creating a Timesheet.

Let's assume we are manufacturing a mobile phone. As per the Bill of Material, time required for the assembly of components could be one hour. However the actual time taken for it's completion could be more than planned. The actual time tracking provides actual operation cost, hence helps in determining accurate valuation of the manufacturing item.

####Work Order

As per the Bill of Materials of manufacturing item, following are the Operations and Workstation through which raw-material items are processed.
