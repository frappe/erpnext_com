# Project from Customer Portal

If you are working on a Project for a Customer, then the Customer will need to be updated on its progress time-to-time. In ERPNext, since it is a Customer Portal feature, you can let Customer update oneself on the Project's progress via the Customer Portal.

### Add User as a Website User

For a Customer to be able to access the Project from the portal, should be added as a Website User. A Customer can also sign up from the Login Page of your ERPNext account, using the same Email ID as mentioned in the Contact master. Or you can invite that User from the Contact master.

In the Project master, check Customer Details section. Select a Customer and Sales Order associated with this Project.

### Portal View of Project

When a Customer logins from the Portal, he/she will be able to view all the Task for that Project. Also, the customer will be able to update the status of the Tasks or comment when needed.
