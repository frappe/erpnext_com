# Project Profitability

Project and related activities are generally active for longer time periods. While developments keep happening on the Project, there are various transactions that are done against each project. Hence, it becomes important to track the Profitability of a Project to ensure that you don't overspend.

### Project in Sales Transactions

You can link a Project in all the sales transactions like Sales Order, Delivery Note, Sales Invoice, and Payment. Linking Project with the sales transactions will help you in tracking income received against that Project.

In sales transactions, Project field is generally available in the More Information section.

#### Project in Purchase Transactions

The project can also be linked to the purchase transactions like Purchase Order, Purchase Receipt, and Purchase Invoice.

In the purchase transactions, Project's link field is available in the Item table. This is because you could be procuring material for multiple Projects from the same purchase entry.
