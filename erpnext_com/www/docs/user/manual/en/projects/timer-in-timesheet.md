# Timer in Timesheet

**A Timer can be used to record the actual time taken by an employee to finish a particular activity in a Timesheet.**

## Steps to start a Timer:

- In a Timesheet On clicking **Start Timer** a dialog box pops up and you are required to enter the following details:
    * **Activity Type**: The Activity for which you are recording the Time.
    * **Project**: The Project for which you are creating the Timesheet.
    * **Task**: The Task for which you are recording the time in the Timesheet.
    * **Expected Hrs**: Enter the number of hours that you expect the Task to finish in.

- Once you have completed the Task, click on Complete. A new entry will be created in the Timesheet, and the time will get recorded as a Time Sheet in the Time Sheets Table in the Timesheet.

- If the time exceeds the 'Expected Hrs', an alert box appears.
