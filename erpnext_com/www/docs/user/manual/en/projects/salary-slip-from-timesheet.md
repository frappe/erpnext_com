#Salary Slip from Timesheet

If salary / wages for your employees are calculated based on number of hours worked, you can use Timesheet to track actual hours worked, and for creating Salary Slip.

####Employee creates Timesheet

To track actual hours employee has worked for, create Timesheet for each Employee. We suggest you to create Timesheet based on a payment period. For example, if you are paying employee on a weekly basis, create one Timesheet for an Employee for one week. However, you can create multiple Timesheets, and create one Salary Slip for the multiple Timesheets.

####Salary Structure for the Employee

In the Salary Structure of the Employee, check field "Salary Slip Based on Timesheet". On checking this field, you see fields Salary Component and Hour Rate. Amount for that Salary Component (say Basic) will be calculated based on:

<div class=well> Total Timesheet Hours *  Hour Rate </div>

Amount directly for other Salary Components (eg: House Rent Allowance, Phone Allowance) can be defined directly. When creating Salary Slip, Amount for these Salary Component will be fetched as it is.
