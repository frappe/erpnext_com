# Access Log

**Access Log is a security feature that logs all data exports by all users in the system.**
> This feature is enabled by default from v13.

Access logs are created in the following events:

 - Printing of all Forms and Reports
 - Private file downloading
 - Exporting via XLSX/CSV formats

In ERPNext, Access Log is available to [System Managers](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/role-and-role-profile), it can be accessed using our favourite [Awesome Bar](https://frappe.io/blog/erpnext-features/erpnext-awesome-bar) or through:
