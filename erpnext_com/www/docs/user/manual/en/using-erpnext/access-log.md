# Access Log

Access Log is a security feature that logs all data exports by all users in the system. This feature is enabled by default from **v13**.

Available to `System Managers`, it can be accessed using our favourite [Awesome Bar](/docs/user/manual/en/using-erpnext/articles/Global-search).

Buttons are enabled dynamically for easy access with relevant data, keeping simplicity at the core.

In ERPNext, access logs are created in the following events:

 - Printing of all Forms and Reports
 - Private file downloading
 - Exporting via XLSX/CSV formats
