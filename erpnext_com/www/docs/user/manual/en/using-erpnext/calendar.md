### 1.1. Event Based on a Lead

In the Lead form, you will find a field called Next Contact By and Next Contact Date. Once you specify the date and the User in these fields, an event will automatically be created for the User on the given date and time.

### 1.3. Birthday Event

Birthday Event is created based on Date of Birth specified in the Employee master.

### 1.4. Recurring Events

There are various events in an organization that occur regularly at periodic intervals. In ERPNext, you can create such events by enabling the 'Repeat this Event' property for that particular event. 

When you do this, you will ve asked to enter the periodicity of this event in the 'Repeat On'. This could be daily, monthly, weekly or Yearly. 

You can also enter the last day of the repeated occurrence in the 'Repeat Till' field. In case of infinite repetitions, you may choose to leave this field blank.
