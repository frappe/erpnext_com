#Keyboard Shortcuts

ERPNext Version 12 is almost fully accessible using keyboard shortcuts.

####Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog

The keyboard shortcuts for any page can be viewed by opening the keyboard shortcuts dialog from the Help dropdown on the navbar.

The dialog shows you a list of global shortcuts which can be used over the entire app as well as a list of shortcuts that are specific to the current page.

#### Using ALT for Shortcuts

Similar to the pattern used by Windows, ALT is an important key for keyboard shortcuts on ERPNext. Pressing ALT on any page underlines a single character on the Page Menu buttons as well as the buttons on the sidebar. Pressing the underlined character while keeping Alt pressed triggers the button click.

Here, N on the New button is underlined, so pressing ALT + N opens the New Customer dialog:

For the Menu dropdown, a single character on each dropdown item is also underlined so the item can be clicked by pressing the underlined character while keeping Alt pressed:

####List View

As specified in the Keyboard Shortcuts Dialog, List View is navigable using the UP and DOWN arrow keys. ENTER opens the list item and SPACE selectes the list item. SHIFT + DOWN, SHIFT + UP can be used to select multiple list items.
