# Asset Settings

In Asset Settings, there is an option to manage how accounting on asset depreciation is done.

The available options is:

* **Disable CWIP Accounting**: By default, accounting entry for assets which are not used are posted in the Capital Work in Progress accounts. This happens when you own the Asset but it isn't being used yet, i.e. 'Available for Use Date' is at a later date. If you use all your assets immediately, enable this feature. On enabling this, CWIP accounting will be skipped.
