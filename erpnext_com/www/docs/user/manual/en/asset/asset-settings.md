# Asset Settings

In Asset Settings, there are options to manage how the asset depreciation takes place.

The available options are:

* **Calculate Prorated Depreciation Schedule Based on Fiscal Year**: 

* **Disable CWIP Accounting**: By default, accounting entry for assets which are not used are posted in the Capital Work in Progress accounts. This happens when you own the Asset but it isn't being used yet, i.e. 'Available for Use Date' is at a later date. If you use all your assets immediately, enable this feature. On enabling this, CWIP accounting will be skipped.
