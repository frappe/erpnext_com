# Asset Category

**An Asset Category classifies different assets of a Company.**

The first step towards asset management is creating Asset Category based on the type of assets. For example, all your desktops and laptops can be part of an Asset Category named "Electronic Equipments".

In Asset Category, you can set default a depreciation method, periodicity and depreciation related accounts, which will apply to all the assets under the category.

> **Note:** You can also set default depreciation-related Accounts and Cost Centers in Company master.

To access the Asset Category list, go to:
