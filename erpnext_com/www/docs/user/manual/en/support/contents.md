# Support

Great customer support and maintenance is at the heart of any successful small
business. With ERPNext you track all incoming customer requests and issues
so that you can respond quickly. The database of incoming
queries will also help you to identify the biggest opportunities for
improvements.

You can track incoming queries from your email using Support
Ticket. You can keep track of Customer Issues linked with a specific
Serial No and respond to them based on their warranty and other information.
You can also make Maintenance Schedules for Serial NOs and keep a record of
all Maintenance Visits made to your Customers.
