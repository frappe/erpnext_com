## Employee Group

Employee groups allow you to group a set of employees together. You can define employee groups, based on common criteria, by grouping employees manually by employee number, a combination of both.

## Service Level Agreement

A service level agreement (SLA) is a contract between a service provider (either internal or external) and the end user that defines the level of service expected from the service provider. SLAs are output-based in that their purpose is specifically to define what the customer will receive. SLAs do not define how the service itself is provided or delivered.
