# Territory

If your business operates in multiple Territories (could be countries, states,
or cities) it is usually a great idea to build your structure in the system for easier use during transactions.
Once you group your Customers by Territories, you can set annual targets for
each Item Group and get reports that will show your actual performance in the
territory versus what you had planned. You can also set different pricing for the same product sold across different territories.

## Allocate Item Group Wise Target

In the Territory master, you will find a table called Territory Targets.

In this table, select Item Group, Fiscal Year, Target Qty, Target Amount, and Target Distribution.

You can give target in amount or quantity, or both. Item Group can also be left blank. In this case, the system will calculate the target based on All Item Groups.

## Territory Target Variance Based On Item Group
This report will provide you variance between target and actual performance of the Sales Partner based on the Sales Order / Sales Invoice / Delivery Note data. User can view this report period wise like monthly, Quarterly, Half-Yearly and Yearly.
