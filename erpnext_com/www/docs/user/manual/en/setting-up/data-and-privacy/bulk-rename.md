# Bulk Renaming of Records

You can rename a document in ERPNext (if it is allowed) by going to **Menu > Rename** in the document.

Alternatively, if you want to rename a whole bunch of records, just go to:

> Setup > Data > Rename Tool

This tool will allow you to rename multiple records at the same time.

### Example

To rename multiple records, upload a **.csv** file with the old name in the first column and the new name in the second column and click on **Upload**.
