# Data Import

Data Import (formerly known as the Data Import Tool) is a great way to upload (or edit) bulk data, specially master data, into the system.

To begin importing the Data, go to either setup, or to the Transaction you want to import, or simply type so in Global Search!

## 1. Downloading The Template

Data in ERPNext is stored in tables, much like a spreadsheet with columns and
rows of data. Each entity in ERPNext can have multiple child tables associated
with it too. The child tables are linked to the parent tables and are
implemented where there are multiple values for any property. For example an
Item can have multiple prices, An Invoice has multiple Items and so on.

  * Select Doctype for which template should be downloaded.
  * Check fields to be included in the template.
  * Select the file format of the template file.
  * For a blank template, make sure that the "Download with Data" field is unchecked.
  * For bulk editing, you can check "Download With Data".

### 2. Fill in the Template

After downloading the template, open it in a spreadsheet application (like Excel, Numbers or Libre Office) and fill in the data below the column headings.

Then export your template or save it as a Excel or Comma Separated Values (CSV)
file. To export the document in Excel tick the checkbox for Download in Excel File Format

#### Notes:

1. Make sure that if your application allows, use encoding as UTF-8.
1. Keep the ID column blank for new records.

### 4. Uploading All Tables (Main + Child)

If you select all tables, you will get columns belonging to all the tables in
one row separated by `~` columns.

If you have multiple child rows then you must start a new main item on a new
row. See the example:


    Main Table                          ~   Child Table
    Column 1    Column 2    Column 3    ~   Column 1    Column 2    Column 3
    v11         v12         v13             c11         c12         c13
                                            c14         c15         c17
    v21         v22         v23             c21         c22         c23

> To see how its done, enter a few records manually using forms and export
"All Tables" with "Download with Data"

### 5. Overwriting

ERPNext also allows you to overwrite all / certain columns. If you want to
update certain columns, you can download the template with data. Remember to
check on the “Update Records” box before uploading.

> Note: For child records, if you select Overwrite, it will delete all the
child records of that parent.

### 6. Upload Limitations

You can only upload upto 5000 records in one go. (may be less in some cases).

Why is this? Uploading a lot of data can cause your system to crash, specially
if there are other users doing things in parallel. Hence ERPNext restricts the
number of “writes” you can process in one request.

### Import Options

#### 1. Update records

This option let's you edit/overwrite the current data on import.

#### 2. Skip rows with errors

If this is checked, rows with valid data will be imported and invalid rows will be dumped into a new file for you to import later.

#### 3. Submit after importing

If this is checked, in case there are submittable transactions which are imported ()

#### 4. Ignore encoding errors

In case there are any unicode errors, a new file with the invalid rows will be created to be imported later.

***

#### How to Attach files?

When you open a form, on the right sidebar, you will see a section to attach
files. Click on “Add” and select the file you want to attach. Click on
“Upload” and you are set.

#### What is a CSV file?

A CSV (Comma Separated Value) file is a data file that you can upload into
ERPNext to update various data. Any spreadsheet file from popular spreadsheet
applications like MS Excel or Open Office Spreadsheet can be saved as a CSV
file.

If you are using Microsoft Excel and using non-English characters, make sure
to save your file encoded as UTF-8. For older versions of Excel, there is no
clear way of saving as UTF-8. So save your file as a CSV, then open it in
Notepad, and save as “UTF-8”. (Sorry blame Microsoft for this!)
