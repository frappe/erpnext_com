# Role Permission for Page and Report

In ERPNext, user can make a custom user interface using Page and a custom report using [Report Builder](https://erpnext.com/docs/user/videos/learn/report-builder.html) or [Query Report](https://frappe.io/docs/user/en/guides/reports-and-printing/how-to-make-query-report). ERPNext has a role-based permission system where user can assign roles to the user. And the same role can be assigned to the page and report, to access them.

If the user has enabled developer mode, then they can add the roles directly in the page and report record. In that case, the permissions will also be reflected in the JSON file for the page/report.

To access Role Permission for Page and Report, go to:
> Home > Users and Permissions > Permissions > Role Permission for Page and Report
