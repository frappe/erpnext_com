# Sharing

In addition to user and role permissions, you can also Share a document with another user if you have sharing rights for that document.

To share a document, open the document, click on the "+" icon under sharing and select the user with whom you want to share:

<img class="screenshot" src="{{docs_base_url}}/assets/img/setup/users/share.png">

In the popup window, you can either select all users or one particular user.

Read, write, and share access can be granted to the user for this document.
Ticking Notify by Email will send an email notifying the user that this document has been shared with them.
