# Users And Permissions

In ERPNext, you can create multiple users and assign them different roles. There are some users who can only access the public facing part of ERPNext (i.e. a portal view). Such users are called "Website Users".

ERPNext implements permission control at the User and Role level. Each user in the system can be assigned multiple roles and permissions.

The most important role is the "System Manager". Any user having this role can add other users and set roles to all users.
