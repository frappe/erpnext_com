# Role and Role Profile

Most commonly used roles are already defined in ERPNext, but you can add more if you want to.

Role Profiles act as a template to store multiple. This Role Profile can then be assigned to a [User](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/adding-users). For example, Sales Supervisor will have the roles Employee, Sales Manager, Sales User, and Sales Master Manager.

You can add two factor authentication for the role and also restrict it to a specific domain. From here, you can go to the Role Permissions manager and set permissions for the role across different DocTypes.
