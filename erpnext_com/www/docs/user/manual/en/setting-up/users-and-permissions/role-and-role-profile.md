# Role and Role Profile

**Role defines the permissions. Role profiles encompass different roles.**

Most commonly used roles are already defined in ERPNext, but you can add more if you want to.

Role Profiles act as a template to store multiple. This Role Profile can then be assigned to a [User](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/users-and-permissions/adding-users). For example, Sales Supervisor will have the roles Employee, Sales Manager, Sales User, and Sales Master Manager.
