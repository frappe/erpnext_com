# Manual Feedback Request

> NOTE: This feature has been removed in Version 12 as it was not very configurable and can be done better with Web Forms and Notifications

We can also send the feedback request to Customer/User without configuring the
Feedback Trigger.

To request a feedback manually go to respective document e.g. Sales Order, Issue etc.
and click on Request Feedback option in Menu.

Then, user can enter the feedback request details like email id, message and send the
feedback request mail.

Note. If Feedback Trigger is already configured for the document then system will fetch
Feedback Request details (email id, message)
