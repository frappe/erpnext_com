In ERPNext you can send any document as email (with a PDF attachment) by clicking on Menu > Email after opening any document.

**Note:** You must have outgoing [email accounts](/docs/user/manual/en/setting-up/email/email-account) setup for this.

After you click on send, the email gets added to the email queue. It will be in the Sending status until it is Sent.
