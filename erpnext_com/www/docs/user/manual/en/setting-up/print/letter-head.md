#Letter Head

Every company has a default Letter Head. These Letter Head values are generally set as Header and Footer in the documents. In ERPNext, you can capture these details in the Letter Head master.

These details will appear in the Print Format of transactions like Sales Order, Sales Invoice, Salary Slip, Purchase Order, etc.

To access Letter Head, go to:
> Home > Settings > Printing > Letter Head > New

## How to create a Letter Head
1. Enter a name for the Letter Head. You can create a separate Letter Head for different office locations.
1. Choose whether based on image or HTML.
1. You can enter details in a Letter Head by using:

  * Logo Image: Click on the Attach button to attach an image. Once the image is inserted, HTML for it will be generated automatically.
  * Other information (like Address, tax ID, etc.) that you want to put on your letterhead.
