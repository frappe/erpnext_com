# Setting Up Taxes

One of the primary motivators for compulsory use of accounting tools is the
calculation of taxes. ERPNext allows you to make configurable tax templates that you can apply to your sales or
purchase transactions.

## Tax Accounts

For Tax Accounts that you want to use in the tax templates, go to **Home > Accounting > Masters and Accounts > Chart of Accounts**, select an account and click on edit. Select the 'Account Type' as 'Tax' for the account.
