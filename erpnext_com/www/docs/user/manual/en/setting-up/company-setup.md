# Company

**A company is a legal entity made up of an association of people for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise.**

In ERPNext, the first Company is created on completion of account creation. For each Company, you can set a domain as manufacturing, retail, or services depending on the nature of your business activity.

If you have more than one company, you can add them from:

> Home > Accounting > Company

### 1.1 Other Options when creating a company

* **Domain**: The domain of work the company is into. Eg: manufacturing, services, etc. Choose one when setting up your account.
* **Is Group**: If checked, this becomes a parent company.
* **Parent Company**: If this is a child company, set the parent from this field. If a parent company is set, the chart of accounts for a new company will be created on the basis of the parent company.

### 1.2  Tree View
The tree view displays the overall structure of your companies.

Once you build a company tree, ERPNext will validate if the accounts of the child companies match the accounts in the parent company. All the accounts can be combined in a consolidated chart of accounts statement.

### 1.3 Chart of Accounts
On each Company, the master for Chart of Accounts is maintained separately. This allows you to maintain separate accounting for each company as per the legal requirements.

ERPNext has localized Chart of Accounts readily available for some countries. When creating a new Company, you can choose to setup the Chart of Account for it from one of the following options.

* Standard Chart of Accounts
* Based on Existing Company's Chart of Account

These default accounts will help you in the quick posting of accounting transactions, where the value for the account will be fetched from the Company master if provided.
