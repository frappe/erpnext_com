### How to use Energy Point System?
To start using this system you need to [create some Energy Point Rules](#how-to-create-energy-point-rules?) so that user can get energy points based on their activities.

### What is Energy Point Rules?
Energy Point Rules store the information about the activity and the value of points to be alloted.

Energy Point Rule has following fields:

| Field        | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| Reference DocType| Document Type you want to apply rule on eg. Task, ToDo, Issue, etc. |
| Condition| Condition for the point allocation. <br>eg. `doc.status == 'Closed'`<br>The above condition will check whether the `status` field in the document is 'Closed' and if yes then the points will be alloted to the user.       |
| Points | Points to be alloted.|
| User Field | Field from which user will be selected eg. `Resolved By`, `Modified By`, `Owner`, etc. can be used.      |
| Multiplier Field | Field which stores value for multiplier. This field must have numeric value, this will be multiplied with Points defined in the rule.      |
