# Bulk Renaming of Records

**Bulk Renaming allows renaming multiple records at once.**

You can rename a document in ERPNext (if it is allowed) by going to **Menu > Rename** in the document.

Alternatively, if you want to rename a whole bunch of records, use the Rename Tool. Go to:

> Home > Settings > Data > Rename Tool

This tool will allow you to rename multiple records at the same time.

## 1. Example

To rename multiple records, upload a **.csv** file with the old names in the first column and the new names in the second column. Then click on **Upload**.
