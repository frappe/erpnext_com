# Quality Management System

> Introduced in Version 12

 Quality management is the act of overseeing all activities and tasks needed to maintain a desired level of excellence in tasks.

 A Quality Management System is used to comply with ISO quality standards. The tool eliminates the need for paper records and replaces them with digital records. The application helps service and manufacturing companies to manage day-to-day work and instills full transparency across the system.
 It helps an organization in making Quality Goals and design Quality Procedures to achieve it.
