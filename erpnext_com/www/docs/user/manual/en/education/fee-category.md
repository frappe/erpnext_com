# Fee Category

**Fee Category would form all the components for calculation of Fees or creation of Fee Structure.** 

An educational institute collects different types of fees for a course. These categories help in defining the fee structure.

E.g. Tuition Fees and Hostel fees would make the different categories of fees.
