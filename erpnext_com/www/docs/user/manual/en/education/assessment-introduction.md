#Assessment

Every education institute organizes assessment / examination to evaluates progress of their Students. In ERPNext, you can manage complete assessment processing for your ERPNext account.

Following is the order in which you should setup masters in the Assessment module.

1. Assessment Criteria
2. Assessment Group
3. Grading Scale

Once you have also defined the Student Group and Courses, you can schedule an assessment / examination by creating Assessment Plan.

Based on the performance of Student in the assessment, you can create Assessment Result for an Student. You can create Assessment Results in bulk using Assessment Result Tool. In this tool, on selection of Assessment Plan, all the students (for Student Group) will be fetched. You can quickly enter marks earned by each Student for each Assessment Criteria in a single row.
