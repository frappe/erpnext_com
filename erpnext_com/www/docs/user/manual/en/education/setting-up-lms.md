# Learning Management System

The Education module is bundled with a Learning Management System (LMS) out of the box. This allows institutes to publish their programs on their website. Programs can contain rich text articles, videos, and even quizzes. The progress of individual students can be tracked through the desk as well as the portal.

LMS is disabled by default and can be enabled from Education Settings.

To enable LMS go to:

> Education > Education Settings > LMS Settings

Enter a title to be displayed on the portal (if not set, the portal title will be set to the default company name). You can also add a description to be displayed on the portal.
