# Academic Term

An academic term (or simply "term") is a portion of an academic year, the time during which an educational institution holds classes. The schedules adopted vary widely. The academic term can be a quater, trimester or a semester.

The **Academic term** form in ERPNext enables you to create academic terms within in a year. Based on the term schedule enter the start and end date for the schedule and generate the term for a Academic year.
