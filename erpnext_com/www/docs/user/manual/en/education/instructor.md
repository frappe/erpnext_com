An **Instructor** can also be linked to a **Course Schedule**, where you can define the schedule for a **Course** for a give date and **Room no**.

It is also linked to **Student group** where an **Instructor** is assigned to the Student Group.

While creating the **Assessment Plan** for a Student Group, **Instructor** can be linked as the Examiner or the Supervisor for that assessment.

Further, the log for the Instructor can be entered in the Instructor Log table which can be used for keeping the records of subjects taught by that Instructor.
