# Request for Quotation

**A Request for Quotation is a document that an organization sends to one or more suppliers asking a quotation for items.**

![Buying Flow](/docs/assets/img/buying/buying_flow_rfq.png)

To access Request for Quotation, go to:
> Home > Buying > Purchasing > Request for Quotation

## 1. Prerequisites
Before creating and using a Request for Quotation, it is advised that you create the following first:

* [Supplier](/docs/user/manual/en/buying/supplier)
* [Item](/docs/user/manual/en/stock/item)

## 2. How to create a Request For Quotation
1. Go to the Request For Quotation list, click on New.
2. Enter the date.
3. Choose the supplier to whom Request for Quotation is to be sent.
4. In the next table, enter items, quantity and the target warehouse where you'll be sending the items.
1. Warehouse can be left blank if 'Maintain Stock' is unticked for the item.
5. Save and submit.

A Request for Quotation (RFQ) can also be created from a submitted Material Request. Once an RFQ is created, you can print and send them the PDF which will have all the details you entered relevant to the RFQ and receive reply by mail. You can also get their reply (Supplier Quotation) from ERPNext itself, see section _3.1 Supplier Quotation by User_. However, for a large number of items, your supplier may be more comfortable with an Excel sheet etc.,

## 3. Features

### 3.1 Get items from
The items in the items table can be fetched from other documents. The options are: Material Request, Opportunity, and Possible Supplier.

* **Material Request**: Items will be fetched from a submitted Material Request that you select. A Material Request can be searched with some matching words and a date range can also be selected to filter the Material Requests.

* **Opportunity**: Items will be fetched from a saved Opportunity. A date range can be selected here also.

* **Possible Supplier**: Select a possible supplier. Then if you have any submitted Material Requests against this supplier, items can be fetched from that.

### 3.2 The Get Suppliers button
Instead of entering the suppliers manually in the table, you can also fetch them using this button. When you click on the Get Suppliers button, you will see a field 'Get Suppliers By'. There are two options to fetch suppliers: by tags or by groups. 

* **By tag**: Go to 'Tag Category' via searching from the search bar. You must have created tags here first and assigned them the the DocType Supplier in the Buying module. Then you can select by Tag and enter a get. On clicking Add 'All Suppliers', suppliers with matching tags will be fetched.

* **By Group**: Select 'Supplier Group' and choose the supplier group from which suppliers need to be added. For example, if you select Hardware, all your hardware suppliers will be added so that you can get a quote from all of them.

In the Supplier table, on expanding a row with the inverted triangle, you'll see an option 'Download PDF' which will open a PDF of the RFQ.

### 3.3 Message for Supplier
Enter any additional messages for the Supplier in this field. This field can be auto filled using an 'Email Template'. The field to select an Email Template is just above Message for Supplier.
