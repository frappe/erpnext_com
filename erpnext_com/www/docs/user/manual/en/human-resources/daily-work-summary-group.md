You can set multiple groups with different set of _users_ from your user list with different _time to send emails_ and with separate _holiday list_ for each.

You can also choose to customize the _Message_ you send to users.

**Note:**
>1. If no holiday list is selected then the email will be sent every day.
>2. Name of a "Daily Work Summary Group" will be sent as the title for daily summary email.
>3. Mail will not be sent to the users of a disabled Daily Work Summary Group.
via HR module or search bar and set the users for whom you want to send the reminder.
