# Leave Encashment

For Leave Types which are encashable, you can submit Leave Encashment. To create a new Leave Encashment, go to

> Human Resources > Leaves and Holiday > Leave Encashment > New Leave Encashment

As you select Employee and Leave Type, Leave Balance and Encashable Days (which is total leave balance less the threshold days set in Leave Type) will be shown along with the Encashment Amount based on the Leave Encashment per day as configured in the Employee's assigned Salary Structure.
