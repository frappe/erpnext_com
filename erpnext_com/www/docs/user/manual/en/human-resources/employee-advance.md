# Employee Advance

Sometimes employees go outside for company's work and company pays some amount for their expenses in advance. At that time, the employee can create Employee Advance form and the expense approver can submit the advance record after verification. After Employee Advance gets submitted, the accountant releases the payment and makes the payment entry.

To make a new Employee Advance, go to:

> Human Resources > Travel and Expense Claims > Employee Advance > New Employee Advance
