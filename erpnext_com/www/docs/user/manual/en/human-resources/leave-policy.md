It is a practice for many enterprises to enforce a general Leave Policy to effectively track and manage Employee leaves. ERPNext allows you to create and manage multiple Leave Policies and allocate leaves to Employees as defined by the policy.

### Enforcing the Leave Policy

To enforce the Leave Policy, you can either:

* Apply the Leave Policy in Employee Grade

This will ensure all leave allocations for all employees of this grade will be as per the Leave Policy

* Update Employee record with appropriate Leave Policy. In case you need to selectively update the Leave Policy for a particular Employee, you can do so by updating the Employee record.
