**A Leave period is a duration of time for which leaves are allocated.**

Most companies manage leaves based on a Leave Period, corresponding to a calendar year or the fiscal year. To access Leave Period, go to:

> Human Resources > Leaves > Leave Period

Once the information is saved, the Leave Period also doubles up as a tool to help you grant leaves for a category of employees. The **Grant** button will generate Leave Allocations based on the Leave Policy applicable to each Employee. You can allocate leaves based on Employee Grade, Department or Designation.
