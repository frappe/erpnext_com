# Leave Period

Most companies manage leaves based on a Leave Period, corresponding to a calendar year or the fiscal year. ERPNext allows you to create a Leave period by going to,

> Human Resources > Leaves and Holiday > Leave Period > New Leave Period

The Leave Period also allows you select the list a Holiday List which will be considered for allocating Optional Leaves for the period.
### Granting Leaves to Employees

Leave Management in ERPNext is based on [Leave Allocations](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-management/leave-allocation.html) created for each employee. This means, Employees can only avail as many leaves (of each Leave Type) allocated to them. 

You can configure [Leave Policies](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-management/leave-policy.html) and apply the Leave Policy for different Employee Grades or to specific Employees. The `Grant` button will allow you to create leave allocations in bulk. Alternatively, you can also create Leave Allocations manually.
