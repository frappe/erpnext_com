Once the information is saved, the Leave Period will also be used as a tool to help you grant leaves for a category of employees. 

The **Grant** button will generate Leave Allocations based on the Leave Policy applicable to each Employee. You can allocate leaves based on Employee Grade, Department or Designation as shown below.
