### Regional - India
For the current fiscal year, in India, House Rent Allowance (HRA) exemption from taxable earnings is the minimum of:

* The actual amount allotted by the employer as the HRA.
* Actual rent paid less 10% of the basic salary.
* 50% of the basic salary, if the employee is staying in a metro city (40% for a non-metro city).

As part of the Employee Tax Exemption Declaration, employees shall also fill out the HRA Exemption. ERPNext will calculate the exemption eligible for HRA and exempt it while calculating the taxable earnings.

> Note: HRA component shall be configured in Company for HRA exemption to work
