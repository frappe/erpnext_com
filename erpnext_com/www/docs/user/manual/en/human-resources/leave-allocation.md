> **Note:** Check the 'Add unused leaves from previous allocations' checkbox in case you want to carry forward unused leaves from previous allocation period for this particular Leave Type.

### 2.1 Allocating Leaves through Leave Period

 Leaves are usually allocated for a particular [Leave Period](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-period). Once a Leave Period is created and saved, you can click on the **Grant** button to generate Leave Allocations based on the [Leave Policy](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/leave-policy) applicable to each Employee.

 You can allocate leaves based on Employee Grade, Department or Designation. Also, note that 'Add unused leaves from previous allocations' check will enable you to carry forward any unused leaves (for Leave Types with 'Is Carry Forward' turned on) from previous allocations to new ones.

Once the Leaves are granted, Leaves will be allocated to the selected Employees based on the Leave Policy set in the [Employee](/docs/user/manual/en/human-resources/employee) master.
