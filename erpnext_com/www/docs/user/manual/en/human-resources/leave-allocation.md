# Leave Allocation

Leave Allocation enables you to allot a specific number of leaves to a particular employee. You can allocate a number of leaves to different types of leave.

### Allocating leaves for a Leave Period

> Human Resources > Leaves and Holiday > Leave Period

Leave Period helps you manage leaves for a period and also doubles up as a tool to help you grant leaves for a category of employees. The _Grant_ button will generate Leave Allocations based on the Leave Policy applicable to each Employee. You can allocate leaves based on Employee Grade, Department or Designation. Also, note that _Carry Forward Leaves_ check will enable you to carry forward any unused leaves (for Leave Types with Is Carry Forward turned on) from previous allocations to new ones.
