## Theme

The Configure Dialog is there for bootstrapping a basic theme. However, if you
know SCSS and Bootstrap 4 theming you can manually write custom SCSS in the
Theme field and the corresponding CSS file will be compiled and applied to your
website. Learn more about [Bootstrap 4 Theming](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/theming/).

If you take a look at the default theme generated by the configure dialog, it
imports `frappe/public/scss/website` and `erpnext/public/scss/website`. These
are the default theme files for `frappe` and `erpnext` app. You can remove them
if you want to write all of the CSS by yourself.

## Custom JS

You can also write custom JavaScript that will run when your theme is applied.
Use it add/remove classes from elements, or any script that helps you change how
your elements look.

> **Note:** Make sure you set the Website Theme in Website Settings for the theme to
> be applied.
