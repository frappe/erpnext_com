# Blog Post

Blogs are a great way to share your thoughts about your business and keep your
customers and readers updated of what you are up to.

In the age of internet, writing assumes a lot of significance because when
people come to your website, they want to read about you and your product.

To create a new blog, go to:

> Website > Blog > Blog Post
