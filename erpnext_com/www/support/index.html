			<h5>What happens after my enterprise contract expires?</h5>
			<p class='mb-5'>
				You can continue to use ERPNext on your server after your enterprise support license expires, but you will have to manage your own support and server management. Some features like in-app support will also stop working.
			</p>

			<h5>If ERPNext is Free and Open Source, why charge per user?</h5>
			<p class='mb-5'>
				ERPNext is Free and Open Source ("free" as in "free-speech"), but the services around ERPNext need engineers to support you. These are what is charged.
				Since scale, complexity and support requirement of a deployment is proportional to the number of users, the Enterprise Support contract is also priced per user.
				Also most ERP products are priced per user, so it is easy to compare with other products. ERPNext Support is a fraction of what you would pay for NetSuite, SAP or Oracle Cloud.
			</p>

			<h5>Is there a separate pricing for Employee Self-Service (HR module only) user?</h5>
			<p class='mb-5'>
				No. ERPNext is not restricted to just one module, with the standard support, customers can access all modules like and CRM, Projects, Helpdesk.

			<h5>Is ERPNext available in my language?</h5>
