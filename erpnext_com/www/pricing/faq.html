				<h5>How is the fees calculated for the number of users?</h5>
				You only pay for the number of System users in your account. These are the users who can access the core modules of the ERP and not just portal views.<br><br> 
                
                A system user is generally someone with system roles like manager in Sales/Purchase/Manufacturing/HR, Leave Approver, Employee, Auditor, etc. These roles are assigned from the user's settings page.
