# Pricing FAQs

### Q. How is the number of users you are going to charge for is calculated?

You only pay for the number of System users in your accounts.

### Q. Who is a system user?

This is without a doubt, a very common question we come across.

In simple terms, a System User is one who heavily interacts with the system using the Desk. 

### Q. What is this Desk you are talking about?

When you log in to your ERP system, and you can see a purple background with a bench of icons, that is the Desk!

<div> <!--class="col-sm-12 text-center mar-t-40"> -->
    <img src="/assets/erpnext_com/images/erpnext-desk.png" class="img-responsive"
        alt="ERPNext Desk Screen" style="padding-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 17px; width:800px; margin:auto;">
</div>


A user can access the desk if they have any system roles like any of the User/Manager roles, Leave Approver, Blogger, Employee, Auditor, etc. which are assigned from the user's settings page.

Roles like Supplier, Customer, Student, etc. are Website Users who are not counted in your plan. These users can view pages permitted to them via the <a href="https://erpnext.org/docs/user/manual/en/customer-portal" target="_blank">portal</a> generated from your account.

### Q. I'm an Indian Customer. Do I also have to pay in USD?

No. Indian customers will be paying in Rupees. The per user pricing for Indian Customers is â‚¹10,000/user/year inclusive of GST.

### Q. Can I get a discount?
