# Security and Privacy

This is only applicable if you are using our services.

We take your privacy seriously and will take all measures to protect your personal information. Any personal information received will only be used to reply to your queries or fix your bugs. We will not sell or redistribute your information to anyone. All our engineers are bound by a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) before they have access to your data.

### How often do you backup and how many copies do you keep?

Internally we have one live server and one mirror server (a replication of the live servers, should it fail) and we take automated 12 hr backups on Amazon S3 (a very large backup service) and then physical backups every morning on weekdays. Even though we keep 3 backups, we recommend our customer to take their own backups atleast once a week as a good practice.

### Can my competitors steal my data?

We are constantly trying to ensure that your data is not accessible by hackers. We have basic security in place like encrypted (https) sign-in, encrypted passwords, encrypted database name. A lot of things we do we do not disclose because it would defeat the purpose.

### Can I control which users can access what data?

Yes, ERPNext has a powerful role-based permission system in place to ensure that you can accurately control who within your company can access your data and this can be control upto field-level. How do you ensure privacy of our data?

### Can your engineers access our data?

If anyone in our team has to access your data for support, then you will get an email mentioning that one our engineers have accessed your data along with a reason. Our passwords are not accessible to our engineers and are generated via a program. If they need to access the password, they must go via this route. All our employees have a singed a Non-Disclosure of Data agreement with us and they are fully aware of the consequences and risks involved with access of customer data.

### Am I locked into ERPNext?

ERPnext is free and Open Source. This is our biggest advantage against other cloud/SAAS ERPs. In the remote possibility that you do not want our service or we are unable to service, the entire source code with installation instructions is online at github.com. You could hire a freelancer, from popular sites like odesk.com or elance.com and get your own server setup.

### What if ERPNext shuts shop?

We have been running this service since 2008 and we can understand the apprehension depending on a startup business. We have more than 100 (as of end 2012) companies who are depending on ERPNext to run their companies. We are a company with a very lean setup and backed by stable investment and we have a plan to be a long term service provider to SMBs. Moreover, our product is Open Source (see earlier question) and it is easy to setup your own ERPNext server.
