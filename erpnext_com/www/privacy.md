### [What about backups](#what-about-backups)?

On the cloud, we maintain regular SQL backups (from hereon referred to as backup) of your account. A backup is taken every 6 hours.

These backups are stored on Amazon's AWS service. You can refer to its <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/" target="_blank">compliance information</a>. 
 
We recommend that you also maintain your own copy. To download them manually by going to ``` Setup > Download Backups ```.

### [Who can access my account](#who-can-access-my-account)?

We also have an access to your account for adminsitrative purposes. This includes access for support and update purposes.

If anyone in our team has to access your data for support, then you will get an email mentioning that one of our engineers have accessed your data along with a reason. Your passwords are not accessible to our engineers and are generated via a program. If they need to access the account, they must go via this route. All our employees have signed a Non-Disclosure of Data agreement with us and they are fully aware of the consequences and risks involved with access of customer data.

### [How do I check all the changes you have made as an Administrator](#how-do-i-check-all-the-changes-you-have-made-as-an-administrator)?

We will report to you what changes (if any) we have done. At the bottom of each form (or doctypes as we call them) you will see who has made the recent changes. Additionally, you can view the Activity Log Report to track the activities of users in your account. Changes are also made automatically via patches when a new version gets released. In case a patch fails, an Administrator may change your data. In this case too you will receive an email notification of the same.

### [How do you use my data](#how-do-you-use-my-data)?

Any personal information received will only be used to reply to your queries or fix your bugs (and occassionally send Newsletters which you can opt out of). We do not and never will sell or redistribute your information to any third party.

We do track your visits to the website through Google Analytics. This data is collected anonymously and viwed in an aggregated form to understand the user behaviour across companies. The kind of queries we engage with here are like what is the most used transaction in ERPNext, or what do most users do after making a Sales Invoice.

### [How can I see all the information that is stored with you](#how-can-i-see-all-the-information-that-is-stored-with-you)?

### [What if I want to move my data](#what-if-i-want-to-move-my-data)?

ERPNext is free and Open Source. This is our biggest advantage against other cloud/SAAS ERPs. In the remote possibility that you do not want our service or we are unable to service, the entire source code with installation instructions is online at github.com.

All you have to do is download your backup and reinstall on your new server. You can also export only the necessary data in spreadheets (Excel, CSV) and import them in your new instance.
